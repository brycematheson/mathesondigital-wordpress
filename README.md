# MathesonDigital Wordpress
The custom-built theme that I'm using for my personal blog, which can be seen by visiting www.mathesondigital.com.

In case anyone wanted to use my theme, I figured I'd throw it up here. Just a warning, though -- This theme isn't coded very well. The reason I say that, is that it's not coded very well as far as a wordpress theme, goes. Most any modifications you want to do (aside from menus, pages, and blog posts) usually have to be done through editing the code itself. I didn't integrate it with an admin panel or anything like that, because frankly, I don't care. So use it if you want. But you'll have to update the author photo (at this point, it doesn't support multiple authors, because -- again -- it's just for my blog, and I'm the only person who writes to it).

In my theme, I'm also using the "Wordpress Popular Posts" plugin as well as the "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved" plugin. If you want the site to function like mine currently does, you'll need to download and install those plugins.

Feel free to fork it or do whatever the hell you want with it.
